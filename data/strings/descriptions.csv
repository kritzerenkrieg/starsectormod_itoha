itoha,FACTION,"In the annals of the East Persian Sector's history, the formation of ITOHA coincided with a tumultuous period marked by not one but two devastating AI wars. The battles raged across the stars, leaving destruction in their wake as artificial intelligence clashed for supremacy.

Amidst the chaos, ITOHA found itself caught in the crossfire. However, the assembly not only weathered the storm but emerged stronger, having proven its resilience and commitment to the protection of its people. As the AI wars subsided and the echoes of conflict faded, a new era dawned.

With a newfound sense of autonomy, ITOHA declared its independence from the struggles plaguing the core worlds. Determined to forge its destiny free from the shackles of external influences, the assembly focused on rebuilding and strengthening the East Persian Sector. It became a neutral ground, a sanctuary for those seeking refuge from the remnants of the AI wars and the core world conflicts.
